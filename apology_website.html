            <p>Dear Delisha,</p>
            <p>I want to sincerely apologize for my actions and words that hurt your feelings. I realize that my behavior recently, especially when I got angry with you, was completely unacceptable. I am deeply sorry for making you sad, something I never intended to do.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge that I acted out of line and failed to consider your feelings at that moment. I should have handled the situation with more patience and understanding. My words and actions were wrong, and I hope you understand that I never meant to hurt you. I realize that, as someone who cares about you deeply, I should be someone who makes you feel valued and supported, not hurt.</p>
            <p>I take full responsibility for my mistakes. No one deserves to be treated the way I acted, especially someone as important to me as you. I promise to be more mindful of my words and actions in the future. I am committed to improving myself so that this kind of situation doesn’t happen again.</p>
            <p>I sincerely hope you can forgive me and allow me the chance to make things right. I don’t want this to damage the bond we share. If there’s anything I can do to help mend things or make you feel better, please don’t hesitate to let me know.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this. I truly hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.</p>
            <p>With heartfelt apologies,<br>Muhammad Muqri (Bear)</p>
